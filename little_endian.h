  Since the pointers may be misaligned, we cannot do a straight read out of
  them. (It usually works-by-accident on x86 and on modern ARM, but not always
  when the compiler chooses unusual instruction for the read, e.g. LDM on ARM
  or most SIMD instructions on x86.) memcpy is safe and gets optimized to a
  single operation, since the size is small and constant.
